            <h3>Report</h3>

            <p>    
                On April 7th, 2024 at roughly 23:49 UTC, Senior Agent ████ codenamed "ECHO-3", "III" or "3" — who was standing next to the barricade just outside of SCP-457's 
                containment chamber — was approached by three agents from the Foundation's Department of Analytics. One of the agents, 
                codenamed <sup>[<a href="#conclusion_1" title="Jump to Conclusion, Point 1.">1</a>]</sup> "ISO-0" 
                <sup>[<a href="#iso_0" title="Jump to Persons of Interest, Point 1.">1</a>]</sup>, made an attempt to converse with "ECHO-3" but were met with only silence from the 
                Senior Agent. Notably, at the end of this one-sided conversation ISO-0 told ECHO-3 to "Say hello to ECHO-1 for me." 
                <sup>[<a href="#conclusion_2" title="Jump to Conclusion, Point 2.">2</a>]</sup>, this instruction was followed through by ECHO-3 with them also informing ECHO-1 that 
                they will "continue to watch them for further intel." After this, the three DOA Agents began to walk towards the entrance of 
                Sector 3, where they were quickly followed by ECHO-3, the DOA agents were — standing in the junction near the entrance to the sector, where they were — in the 
                process of re-containing the anomaly that's commonly known as "D-9341", ISO-0 was conversing with the anomaly while the other two agents aimed their firearms at it. 
                Evidence in the form of a photograph was captured during this. The three agents began escorting the anomaly back to the Class-D Containment zone with ECHO-3 
                following behind. The escort made it safely to the destination zone without any interference.<br>
                
                <br>
                <br>

                At roughly 23:55 UTC — a few minutes after the re-containment of "D-9341" — while both ECHO-3 and the three DOA agents were still in the Class-D Containment zone a 
                fight ensued between most armed Foundation staff present in the zone and a few armed Class-D, it is known that atleast one staff member was killed during this. Each 
                of the DOA agents were injured during the conflict while ECHO-3 remained unharmed. The armed Class-D were terminated by Foundation personnel which ended the fight. 
                Two of the three DOA agents left the Class-D Containment zone two minutes after the fight. It is unknown what happened to "EXODUS-01" 
                <sup>[<a href="#exodus_01" title="Jump to POI notes">3</a>]</sup> — meaning it is unknown if they were killed during the armed conflict, or if they left the site 
                shortly after it — but it is believed that they left the site. ECHO-3 followed the remaining two agents out from the Class-D Containment zone but lost track of them 
                near the site's control room<br>
                
                <br>
                <br>

                ISO-0 was intercepted in the Faction's area in Sector 2 by ECHO-3 at roughly 00:10 UTC — and the two began to stare at each other — the other DOA agent "ISO-3" 
                <sup>[<a href="#iso_3" title="Jump to POI notes">2</a>]</sup> walked in from further inside the Faction's area and stood behind ISO-0, who began to privately message 
                <sup>[<a href="#conclusion_3" title="Jump to Conclusion, Point 3.">3</a>]</sup> ECHO-3 via the Foundation network, both parties continued to stare the other down 
                during the conversation. Evidence of most of the messages were obtained by ECHO-3. ISO-3 left the Faction's Area through the heavy door and into Sector 2 while the 
                other two continued to talk. ISO-0 concluded the private conversation with ECHO-3 — at approximately 00:32 UTC — before leaving the area and losing ECHO-3 as they 
                were investigating the DOA agents. Both DOA agents were found in the hallway just outside of the Class-D Contaiment zone by ECHO-3 who wasn't noticed for a minute 
                which gave them more time to intercept their internal communications, they were believed to have been spotted which led to ISO-0 walking from their position in the 
                hallway to the now closed-off entrance to the Blast Shelter where they hid behind a crate in an attempt to lose the Senior Agent. ECHO-3 realising where the DOA 
                agent was and what they were attempting to do and began walking towards the Sector 2 entrance checkpoint while looking behind them to see ISO-0 run back to the 
                hallway outside the Class-D Containment zone.<br>
            </p>
               
            <h3>Pause</h3>

            <p>
                ECHO-3 followed ISO-0 back to the hallway — ISO-3 was believed to have not been there when ECHO-3 entered the hallway, or was hiding. ISO-0 wasn't visible when 
                ECHO-3 entered the hallway but heat signature tracking led ECHO-3 to see that ISO-0 was hiding around the wall from ECHO-3 For the next few minutes, both ISO-0 and 
                ECHO-3 made several attempts to stay out of eyesight of the other while also being able to see them. ECHO-3 willingly gave up in order to follow someone they believed 
                was ISO-3, unfortunately, ECHO-3 lost the persons and returned back to the Class-D Containment zone.<br>

                <br>
                <br>
                
                Both DOA agents were found — near the termination line — in the Class-D Contaiment zone, shortly after ECHO-3 entered the main area in the zone, ISO-0 walked towards, 
                and into the nearby viewing room where they adjusted their clothes before returning to ISO-3 who had not moved — it is presumed that the two DOA agents were privately 
                communicating — and stood next to them for a few seconds before again entering the viewing room and fixing their clothes again. ISO-0 exited the viewing room and 
                stood near ECHO-3 — who was standing near one of the barricades next to the steps down that lead further into the Class-D area — while ISO-3 walked into the viewing 
                room and stood next to one of the couches in the room. ISO-0 partially adjusted their clothes before standing near ISO-3 in the viewing room. The two agents 
                remained in the viewing room for two minutes. At 00:59 UTC, once their uniform was adjusted, ISO-0 left the viewing room, standing near ECHO-3 who was still standing 
                near the barricade — it is also noted that another persons who is assumed to also be connected to the Department of Analytics, codenamed "S-045" entered the viewing 
                room.<br>

                <br>
                <br>

                ECHO-3 resumed a passive guard duty — moving to the catwalk near the Class-D kitchen hatch — while also monitoring the DOA agents, alongside the assumed third agent. 
                ISO-0 adjusted their outfit for the last time on the steps near the barricade ECHO-3 stood next to earlier. After a minute, ECHO-3 returned to the aforementioned post 
                where ISO-0 stood next to them. Tensions continued to steadily rise as the Class-D grew restless. Personnel were urgently evacuated from the area as Class-D began to 
                riot. The Class-D continued to riot, eventually pushing back the Foundation to the area near the Security Department's locker room. ISO-3 fought off the Class-D 
                alongside the other Foundation staff but eventually had to drag ISO-0 out to safety near the Blast Shelter entrance after they were shot. ECHO-3 stood in the 
                briefing room near the DOA agents until Foundation Staff were pushed even further back to the Sector 2 entrance checkpoint. Another persons who is also believed to be 
                involved with the Department of Analytics — codenamed "S-071" — was spotted in the crowd near the checkpoint. ISO-0 followed one of the anomalies, SCP-507, into an 
                unmarked containment chamber to the left of SCP-999's containment chamber — the anomaly made a remark about how they didn't feel "secure" which prompted ECHO-3 to 
                believe that ISO-0 was securing this anomaly.<br>

                <br>
                <br>

                ISO-0 was briefly lost before being spotted again amongst the crowd of Foundation Staff that were attempting to fight off the armed Class-D. The two DOA agents then 
                followed two other persons who were holding a detained intelligence agent to SCP-096's contaiment chamber, once in the viewing room both DOA agents and ECHO-3 watched 
                the two persons and the intelligence agent briefly before returning to the Sector 2 checkpoint — it is unknown what happened to the intelligence agent exactly but it 
                is assumed they were terminated by the anomaly. The Class-D riot concluded when the DOA agents and ECHO-3 were walking from Sector 3, back to Sector 2. The two 
                agents stopped upon reaching a crowd in the hallway just outside of the Internal Security Department's armoury and interrogation room. ECHO-3 continued to watch the 
                two mess around with the other personnel from around a corner. ISO-0 shot ISO-3 during this before both agents shortly left the site.

                <sup>[<a href="#conclusion_1" title="Jump to Conclusion, Point 1.">1</a>]</sup>. A few online usernames were linked to this persons, notably

        <div class="conclusions_text">
            <p id="conclusion_1">
                <b>1.</b> The codenames of both Department of Analytics agents; "ISO-0", and "ISO-3" could suggest their internal position within the department. This conclusion 
                works with ISO-0's codename as investigations have assumed them to be the DOA Director. However ISO-3's codename suggets they're the fourth-in-charge of the DOA, 
                but investigation has shown them to be in the "AWG" category of personnel. This could be a flaw in the public management and organisation of their personnel and 
                their positions, or it could be intentional — a method of misdirecting anybody who attempts to investigate them and their hierarchy and/or structure..
            </p>

            <br>

            <p id="conclusion_2">
                <b>2.</b> ISO-0's instruction for ECHO-3 to; <i>"Say hello to ECHO-1 for me."</i>, could imply that ISO-0 knows who ECHO-1 really is within the Foundation and within 
                our unit. This conclusion could work as the personnel behind ECHO-1's identity does work for the Department of Analytics. ECHO-1 could have possibly told the DOA 
                that they are ECHO-1. However, this could also be a method by ISO-0 to make us believe that they know who ECHO-1 is without being told by them. However, this could 
                also be a way for them to tell us they know we have an ECHO-1.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p id="conclusion_3">
                <b>3.</b> ISO-0's private conversation with ECHO-3 possibly proves the unit's theory on how little the Department of Analytics knows about the Unit correct, however 
                this lack information could be a ploy by the DOA into making the Unit believe they know nothing when in reality they know much more.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                <b>4.</b> Considering how ISO-0 was behaving while ECHO-3 was monitoring them, ECHO-3 believes they were writing a report on the senior agent as they were were 
                writing theirs.
