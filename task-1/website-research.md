# English Heritage
English Heritage[^1] is a charity that manages and oversees hundreds of sites—including pre-historic sites, castles, battlefields, forts, etc.—across England. They state they use these sites to 'bring the story of England to life', thus, their website needs to convey this message and attitude. Upon landing on the charity's site you'll notice a very prominent banner that rotates between several images of people at different sites; important places and objects. At the time of viewing this site (which is near the end of the year), there's a message suggesting you to explore their sites: this box is designed to catch your eye with it's bright-red colouring, size and placement over the images. A navigation bar's featured at the header of the page, showing off the logo, links to other pages and the charity's social links. Below the image carousel are a series of cards inviting you to join the charity, to visit their exhibitions/sites and another that links to a featured event. Continuing down the page presents us with more about special events, places to visit, an invite to donate to their appeal, a contact page, and lastly, some relevant news.

The site uses a colour palette of a neutral white and a bold, bright red to emphasise certain elements (mainly buttons); this on purpose to subtly remind viewer's the page is about England, and to draw the viewer's attention to important parts of the site; additionally, the site also provides both lots of, and not enough, information to the viewers—this is so that the reader can be informed about certain events, deals, etc. and so that they're drawn deeper into the site, increasing the likelihood of them donating or joining.

Due to these combined factors of modern website design and web principles and socially acceptable—almost corporate—predation on it's viewers, this site perfectly serves its purpose.

English Heritage's site appeals to their audience of families and school children very well; images featuring families and activities for children, or that children might find interest in are placed across the site. Information for both parents and kids is provided too, which is extremely helpful when planning a day out.

# British Museum
The British Museum[^1] is a public museum dedicated to the history of humans, of art, and of culture.

On landing on their site a hero video (I don't know what to call it) of the museum and several collections within it is playing, a small, white but eye-catching message welcomes you to the site and encourages you to plan your visit to the museum. Below that is some information regarding free entry and opening-closing times. Two boxes that promote exhibitions and events at the museum feature below *that*. A row of four cards that talk about planning a visit, a museum map, galleries, and family visits sit beneath the prior boxes; a promotional banner selling the museum's membership and its benefits follows. The page continues talking about events in history (as expected), collections, the museum itself,  management-related stuff and signing up to a newsletter before ending with a simple site map and a footer.

The museum's use of a black and white palette keeps the aesthetic modern and simple, ensuring the viewer's focus remains on the artifacts and other images; their use of interactive elements gives the reader a feel of interactivity and responsiveness from the site. While the website does seem to repeat itself towards the bottom with the format of four cards and a notice being repeated three times. The British Museum does a subjectively better job than British Heritage at meeting its goals of focusing on history—which is why I decided to lean more towards their style design-wise.

The British Museum manages to appeal to roughly the same target audience as English Heritage—that being families and tourists—with relative success, throughout the site articles, exhibits and events that are aimed towards families and featured prominently. However, they fail to reach the tourist half of their audience as effectively, while tourists are still attracted to the museum due to it's intriguing nature there aren't as many facilities or promotional content toward them.

# Legal & ethical considerations
There are a variety of considerations and constraints to take into account when creating a website, for example: does your site's design take into account accessibility and the complications of different disabilities? If not, it must, as required by the **WCAG 2.2[^2]**.
## Legal
- The website needs to comply with the **DPA 2018[^3]** and **UK GDPR**[^4] should it collect or use data from consumers—which, due to the client's requirement of having a form to join the organisation, it must.

- As previously mentioned, the WCAG 2.2 requires that all websites be accessible to everyone regardless of any disabilities, this includes blindness, deafness, lack of mobility, etc. Certain accessibility features, such as image alternate text for screen readers need to be implemented into the site.

- Additionally, should the client choose to implement a shop for their site, they'll need to comply with a variety of e-commerce regulations, this includes clearly stating pricing, product information and terms somewhere relevant and reachable by the consumer.
## Ethical
While legal constraints are required to be adhered to, ethical constraints no so much—but they still should be followed for the benefit of everyone.
- Being transparent and honest with the consumer about their data usage; the prices of products; the purposes of different parts of the website; or the time at which an event happens can help increase the site's reputation and trust with consumers.

- With the rise of global warming, everyone needs to keep track of and attempt to reduce their carbon footprint, even the website. Optimising code, assets (such as images, videos, etc.) can help reduce the carbon footprint of the site, which in turn benefits the environment. Additionally, keeping the site lightweight and efficient helps more users access it quicker, leading to more positive traffic.
